# TDD Calculator example

## About the project: 🍪

It's a very barebones calculator, the goal is to build it without running the local environment, build it purely with tests. The result and functionality was achieved only by writing tests, failing them, fixing the calculator so it would pass a test and so on.

## Disclaimer: ⚠️

I started this project to practice TDD, don't consider the React code to be a reflection of my ability to write clean code following SOLID principles. My main focus is to get used to the TDD ways of working, I would later refactor the code to make it more readable.
